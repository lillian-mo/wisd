# Transition Plays Resulting from Defensive Rebounds Mapper

Hi! This is our project for the 2023 WISD Hackathon. We decided to make a visualization to show how many defensive rebounds in the games given resulted in low danger, medium danger, or high danger chances, as well as where shots were taken in transition, which we simplified to be 10 seconds post rebound. The functions for the dataframe filtering and cleaning are found in the data.py file, while the functions for the visualizations are found in the viz.py file. All the code along with the visualizations and description are in the final_project_notebook.ipynb notebook. Thank you in advance for reviewing our submission, and we hope you enjoy poking around!
